# Actions-OpenWrt

Build OpenWrt and publish docker image using GitHub Actions

99% of the work are credit to ***P3TERX***, ***bin20088*** and ***flippy***， I just integrated them.

The '.config' files in this repository are for Newifi_D2 and N1 coz those are the devices I use.

Feel free to fork and modify.
